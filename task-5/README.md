# install turtlebot3

##### TurtleBot is a ROS standard platform robot. Turtle is derived from the Turtle robot, which was driven by the educational computer programming language Logo in 1967. In addition, the turtlesim node, which first appears in the basic tutorial of ROS, is a program that mimics the command system of the Logo turtle program. It is also used to create the Turtle icon as a symbol of ROS. The nine dots used in the ROS logo derived from the back shell of the turtle. TurtleBot, which originated from the Turtle of Logo, is designed to easily teach people who are new to ROS through TurtleBot as well as to teach computer programming language using Logo. Since then TurtleBot has become the standard platform of ROS, which is the most popular platform among developers and students.
