-The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.
HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.

-The request method indicates the method to be performed on the resource identified by the given Request-URI.
For example:
- GET : to request data from the server.
- POST : to submit data to be processed to the server.
